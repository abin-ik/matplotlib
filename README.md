🔍 BMW Data Analysis Report

This project explores key insights from the BMW dataset, analyzing various factors such as tax, price, mileage, engine size, and production trends across different transmission types and models.

📊 1. Does increase in tax affect the price of cars for each category?

Answer:
For automatic cars, the tax is generally less compared to others.
However, for semi-automatic models, the price increases as the tax increases, indicating a possible correlation between higher-end semi-auto variants and higher tax brackets.

⚙️ 2. Does the engine size affect the mileage?

Answer:
Yes, engine size significantly affects mileage.

When the engine size is small (close to 0) → mileage is low.

When the engine size is large (close to 6) → mileage is also low.

The best mileage is observed at a medium engine size (~2.5), suggesting an optimal efficiency range.

🚗 3. Which BMW model has the highest sales?

Answer:
The BMW 3 Series model is the most purchased among all models, indicating its popularity and market dominance.

⚡ 4. Has the production of automatic and semi-automatic cars increased over the years compared to manual?

Answer:
Yes. There has been a significant rise in the production of automatic and semi-automatic cars after 2015, showing a clear market shift away from manual transmission vehicles.

🔋 5. Has the production of electric cars increased?

Answer:
Not substantially. The demand for diesel cars still remains high, while electric vehicles have not yet overtaken traditional fuel types in BMW’s lineup.
